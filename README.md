# Fair Stable Matching meets Correlated Preferences

The following repo provides the source code for experiments described in:

Angelina Brilliantova and Hadi Hosseini. 2022. 
Fair Stable Matching MeetsCorrelated Preferences. In Proc. of the 21st International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2022), Online, 
May 9â€“13,2022, IFAAMAS.

Usage:

## Fair Matchings under the Mallows
```
python3 main.py [number of agents] [phi_m] [phi_w]
```

main.py generates samples from the Mallows model (using the sampler from PrefLibTools https://github.com/PrefLib/PrefLib-Tools), and for each sample produce a csv file with optimal and pessimal scores for each instance, the size of the stable lattice, the rotation poset and other statics

## Comparing of a pre-processed DA with other algorithms

This section is the modified code from https://github.com/ntzia/stable-marriage, with an additional pre-processed step for the Deferred Acceptance algorithm (DA*), 
and some new scripts comparing the performance of LDS, EDS, PB, iBILS with DA* when applied to the stable matching instances sampled from the Mallows model.

Usage:
TBA
